## About The Project

![Fluent Steam](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87723899/145287138-7dec612a-eca2-435b-8cf4-c8f99c060050.png)


This is a simple skin which turns the old steam design into a completely renewed one, this skin is inspired by the Microsft Store Fluent Design template launched with Windows 11.

<p> This skin starts from the base code of the <a href="https://github.com/minischetti/metro-for-steam">Metro for Steam 4.4 by minischetti </a> and <a href="https://github.com/redsigma/UPMetroSkin">UP MetroSkin from RedSigma</a>, although the future I plan to get rid of these bases since they have some obsolete files compared to the new versions of steam. </p>
